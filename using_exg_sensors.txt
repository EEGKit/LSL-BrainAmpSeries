Please note that all AUX sensor values are represented in µV.
If you want to convert the voltage to sensor-specific units, you have to apply gradients and offsets as listed in the Brain Products sensor tutorial (https://www.brainproducts.com/files/public/sensor-tutorial/Content/Topics/Intended_Use.htm).
For recordings in MR environment, please consider additional aspects that need to be adhered to.
In addition, use the following correction formula for the GSR MR sensor after applying the gradient (converting to µS):
G=Gp*Gt/(Gp-Gt) with G as the corrected conductance in µS, Gp as the correction value = 100 µS, and Gt as the measured conductance (after the gradient has been applied).
